## Description

This password generator empowers employees with access to sensitive data to create strong and secure passwords effortlessly. Upon clicking the generate button, users are prompted to specify their desired password criteria, including length and character types such as lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. The input provided is validated to ensure at least one character type is selected and that the chosen length falls within the range of 8 to 128 characters. Once all prompts are answered, a password meeting the selected criteria is generated and either displayed in an alert or written to the page, providing users with a reliable tool for enhancing their security practices.
